DataInputStream and DataOutputSTream are both useful for many purpose like write file and write data to be sent to anther file
//File handling using dataStream
when we use Datainputstream to read file then we get the pointer to FileInputStream();
when we use DataOutputSTream to write file the we get the pointer FileOutputStream();
//Data Handling
when we use DataInputSTream to read data  we get a pointer from new InputStream
when we use DataOutputStream to write data we get a pointer  from new OutputStream
